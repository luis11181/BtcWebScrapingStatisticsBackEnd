Simple pupperteer webScraping program that follows the top 100 bitcoin wallets over time, recording the bitcoin prices and amount averages by size of category, the bitcoin amounts of the top 100 wallets, and notify in case of big withdrawals movements.

Due to the "informal" nature of this project it was implemented with an ineficcinet flat-file database, that runs in nodeJs locally and hosted for free in github pages with react.
